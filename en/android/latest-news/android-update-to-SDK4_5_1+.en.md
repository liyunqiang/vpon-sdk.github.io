# Update to 4.5.1+
This news is to show why we suggest you to update the SDK from the previous one to the latest one (4.5.1+). In here, developer can determine what version of SDK are used. By releasing the latest version, developer can update the SDK.

# Why update to 4.5.1+?

1. The latest SDK(4.5.1+) provides publishers a more display-optional environment and better user experience. Some similar modifications could enhance the user experience.

2. After a security discussion with Google, we fixed a potential security problem to protect and make sure userâ€™s network security. Publishers will have a higher-quality SDK in every application.

# How to determine the current SDK version?
There are two ways to detertmine the SDK version in the following:

1. The original file downloaded from Vpon SDK Document shows its version on its name. For instance, the SDK v4.5.1 for Android platform is named `vpadn-sdk-obf451-31406102-1604131557-ca97036.jar` ,  among which `obf451` is the hint to the version 4.5.1.

2. Another way is publishers could see the log messages while running apps which integrated Vpon SDK. Search the key word `doGetSdkParams`  in the log message. There is parameter called `sdk` in VPADN. It shows the current SDK version.
